# CHANGELOG

## [Untagged]

No date

## [26.0]

22.02.22

- Adds `--catalog` to allow an easier way to select which software update catalog to use, rather than the defaults set in `installinstallmacos.py`. Example: `--catalog 10.15` will use the catalog for Darwin version 19, `--catalog 11` will use Darwin version 20. This is to address omissions in the catalogs for older OSes (somewhat addresses #169, #160).
- Allow for more lenient checks for Volume Ownership against the entered username (#177, thanks to @cvgs)
- Adds `--rebootdelay` option (Big Sur or later) (#193).
- DEPNotify counts down the rebootdelay time.
- Adds `--fs` option which makes all the DEPNotify windows full screen (download, confirm, preparation).
- User can dismiss the DEPNotify download and preparation windows if `--rebootdelay` is set to at least 10 seconds.
- Multiple `--preinstall-command` arguments can now be supplied. These run immediately before `startosinstall` is run.
- Multiple `--postinstall-command` arguments can now be supplied. These run after `startosinstall` has finished.
- Checksums of `installinstallmacos.py` are now pinned to a tag of the `macadmins-scripts` repo so that updates to the script don't break a particular version of `erase-install.sh` from working.
- Add a message about process Terminations, which some people were mistakenly believing to be errors.
- Fixed the actual killing of jamfHelper and caffeinate.
- `osascript` dialog windows now run as the user (addresses #198, thanks to @anewhouse).
- Fixed an issue concerning the catalog for macOS High Sierra 10.13 which has an item without a version string listed, which was causing installinstallmacos.py to error out (addresses #169).

## [25.0]

23.11.2021

- Determines free space better by checking free and purgeable space (partial fix for #152; thanks to Pico in MacAdmins Slack).
- Uses exit traps to clean up after all abnormal exits (fixes #140, #141; thanks to @ryangball).
- Adds `-nobrowse` to `hdiutil` to prevent mounted images appearing on the desktop (thanks to @ryangball).
- Allows 5 password attempts (fixes #159).
- Adds dialog to show how much time is left in the power check (#144; thanks to @dan-snelson).
- Some dialog changes, to replace the word "reinstall", which some people have found confusing, with "install" (addresses #149).
- Changed log location to the `$workdir` so that it persists after an upgrade, and also so it is wiped if using the `--cleanup-after-use` option (fixes #161).
- Remove check for membership of `staff` group for Apple Silicon Macs, since Volume Ownership is already checked it's not necessary, and was preventing non-admin AD users from proceeding (fixes #166).
- Re-order some initial statements to ensure that the chosen $workdir has been created before DEPNotify is downloaded and the log file is determined (fixes #165).
- Some minot changes to the Dutch translation (addresses #164, thanks @Alitekawi).

## [24.1]

27.10.2021

- Script now exits if an incorrect password is entered (partially fixes #136).
- Makefile uses `curl` to obtain DEPNotify.app without adding a quarantine bit (fixes #138).
- Fixes for certain workflows involving the `--fetch-full-installer` (#140) and `--pkg` (#141) options.
- Fixed `--user` option, which was not reading in the given user (#142, thanks @chymb).

## [24.0]

25.10.2021

- Removed the "0." from the version, as it's arbitrary and meaningless.
- `--seed` is now analogous to `--seedprogram`.
- New `--cleanup-after-use` option to delete the entire working directory after use (#131).
- `--move` will now move the installer even when using `--erase` or `--reinstall`.
- `--update` option now honours `--beta` and `--seed` options.
- The `--depnotify` option will download DEPNotify.app if it's not already installed.
- Fixed a problem with the `osascript` dialog when downloading an installer.
- Makefile now includes `depnotify` and `nopython` methods. `depnotify` bundles DEPNotify.app into the package, and expects `DEPNotify.zip` in the root of the cloned repo - must be copied there. `nopython` omits the relocatable-python framework (and also omits DEPNotify.app).
- Updated SHA key of `installinstallmacos.py` to reflect merged in upstream changes (updated software catalog URL for macOS 12).

## [0.23.0]

21.10.2021

- The package now includes a relocatable python installation (version 3.9.5) for use with `installinstallmacos.py`. This replaces the reliance on the macOS python2.7 distribution.
- For standalone script runs, erase-install.sh will now check for an existing relocatable python or MacAdmins Python installation. If neither exists, and `--no-curl` is not set, the script will download and install the minimum MacAdmins Python signed package, for use with `installinstallmacos.py`. If `--no-curl` is set, the script will fall back to python 2.
- If `installinstallmacos.py` is downloaded using curl, it is now checked against a defined SHA256 checksum. Note: this is calculated using the command: `shasum -a 256 installinstallmacos.py | cut -d' ' -f1`.
- Add download progress information to the DEPNotify bar (#127, thanks @andredb90, addresses #116).
- Rationalised version comparisons in the code from 3 to 1.

## [0.22.0]

01.10.2021

- Add preparation progress information to the DEPNotify bar (#122, thanks @andredb90).
- SIP check only checks for partial SIP enablement (#110, thanks @anverhousseini).
- New `--preinstall-command` option to run a command prior to the beginning of the `startosinstall` run (thanks Fredrik Virding for the idea).
- Fix build version comparisons (this affected macOS 11.6) (#124, thanks @boberito)
- Allow use of `--confirm` option for reinstallation (#123)
- Improve version comparisons in `check_newer_available` function (should improve `--update` reliability)
- Fix erase or reinstall from a InstallAssistant package if it has not already been extracted with the `--move` option (#111).

## [0.21.0]

20.07.2021

- Add French translation (thanks @Darkomen78).
- Fix version for which `--allowremoval` is set when doing a reinstall (thanks @anverhousseini).
- Kill DEPNotify in places where jamfHelper is killed (#106, thanks @julienvs).
- Added '$script_name' variable - if you want to change the script name, the echo statements will reflect this value rather than 'erase-install'.
- Added `--clear-cache-only` option, which works in conjunction with `--overwrite` or `--update` to perform the removal of cached installers but then quit rather than carry on with any further workflow (#105).
- Added a more verbose message that `--test-run` has been implemented (#93).

## [0.20.1]

12.05.2021

- The Cancel button is now default in the Confirm dialog when not using jamfHelper or DEPNotify. Note that DEPNotify only offers one button so we cannot provide a straightforward Cancel button.
- The contents of the `README.md` have been replaced with a wiki.

## [0.20.0]

07.05.2021

- `--depnotify` option. Uses DEPNotify instead of jamfHelper, if it is installed.
- `--no-jamfhelper` option. Ignores the jamfHelper installation. Useful for testing the `osascript` dialogs.

## [0.19.2]

26.04.2021

- Another fix to the check that `--fetch-full-installer` can be used.
- Edited Dutch localizations (thanks to Thijs Vught)

## [0.19.1]

17.04.2021

- Fix for check that `--fetch-full-installer` can be used.
- Dutch localizations (thanks to Thijs Vught)

## [0.19.0]

07.04.2021

- Output from erase-install.sh is now written to `/var/log/erase-install.sh` in addition to `stdout`.
- Checks that the supplied user is an admin when performing `--eraseinstall` on M1, which appears to be a requirement (not for `startosinstall` without `--eraseinstall`). If it is not, it promotes the user to admin.
- Checks that the supplied user is a Volume Owner on M1 (rather than merely having a Secure Token)
- Runs `diskutil apfs updatePreboot /` prior to `startosinstall` to (experimentally) address a problem seen by some user accounts that were promoted using `Privileges.app`.
- Adds localization for osascript dialogs

## [0.18.0]

10.03.2021

- Add `--check-power` option. Set this to check for AC power. Also `--power-wait-limit` sets a time limit to wait for power (default is 60 seconds).
- Merge in upstream changes to `installinstallmacos.py`. This improves download resumption.

## [0.17.4]

03.03.2021

- Default minimum drive space now set to 45GB, but can now be overridden with the `--min-drive-space NN` option.
- Fixed the `--confirm` option.
- Improved the `--help` output with more recent keys.

## [0.17.3]

20.01.2021

- For Catalina and earlier, do OS validation only as far as the minor release. This allows for the mismatch between advertised build and `DTSDKBuild` (fixes Issue #53).
- Fix for when `VolumeName` is not `Macintosh HD` or any two-word name (fixes Issue #58).
- Added exit 1 code if script exists due to not successfully downloading an installer (fixes Issue #52).
- Increase munimum disk space required to 30GB, which aligns better Apple's recommendation for macOS Big Sur (see [HT211238](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211238)).

## [0.17.2]

06.01.2021

- Testing moving `caffeinate` to the end of the script but using a second `--pidtosignal` argument in `startosinstall` to kill caffeinate. It is not documented that `--pidtosignal` can be called multiple times, so this is experimental, but seems necessary on Big Sur as the "preparing upgrade" step is much longer than with previous OSs.

## [0.17.1]

05.01.2021

- Added `--test-run` option which runs everything except the `startosinstall` command. Useful for testing new workflows.
- Moved the prompt for user details for Apple Silicon Macs up the script so users don't get prompted later.
- No longer checks to see if the user is an administrator as this is apparently not a criterion - only Secure Token matters.
- Bug fix: remove alignment flags in the jamfHelper commands to solve a product issue with jamfHelper on Apple Silicon Macs.

## [0.17.0]

15.12.2020

- New `--current-user` option to use the current logged in user for `startosinstall` authorisation on M1/DTK Macs.
- New `--user` option to specify a user for `startosinstall` authorisation on M1/DTK Macs.
- Now checks whether the specified user is an administrator.
- Now checks whether the specified user has a Secure Token.
- Now checks if the given password is correct.
- New `--no-fs` option for replacing the full-screen display with a utility window (for testing purposes).
- Now quits `caffeinate` before beginning `startosinstall`.
- Now correctly identifies Apple Silicon Mac Device IDs for compatibility checks.
- Now gets the installer version from `/Volumes/Shared Support/com_apple_MobileAsset_MacSoftwareUpdate/com_apple_MobileAsset_MacSoftwareUpdate.xml` as this is a more reliable build number than the one in `Info.plist`.
- Now makes more reliable version comparisons using `BuildVersion` by splitting the check into more sections (`AABCCDDE` instead of `AABCCCCD`).
- Script version number is now displayed when running the script. I just have to remember to update it...
- added `--list-full-installers` option which runs `softwareupdate --list-full-installers` according to the seedprogram selected.
- `test-erase-install.sh` script is now included in the installer package.

## [0.16.1]

10.12.2020

- Bug fix: `--auto` was being incorrectly assigned when using `--os`, `--build` etc.

## [0.16.0]

10.12.2020

- Added the `--pkg` option allowing the download of an `InstallAssistant` package, utilising an update alresdy made to the `installinstallmacos.py` fork. For Big Sur or greater only. This will probably need some more error checking.
- Added the `--keep-pkg` option which prevents the deletion of the package if the `--move` option is used to extract the package to `/Applications`. By default, the package will be deleted on successful extraction.
- Added the `--force-curl` and `--no-curl` options, allowing the control of whether to download `installinstallmacos.py`. This is in anticipation of a Makefile and package release of `erase-install.sh`.
- Added `Makefile`. This allows you to build a self-contained package containing `erase-install.sh` and `installinstallmacos.py` so that curl is not used during the run of `erase-install.sh` to update `installinstallmacos.py`. This requires `munkipkg` and expects to find the `grahampugh` fork of `installinstallmacos.py` in `../macadmins-scripts`. Make sure you don't bundle in Greg Neagle's version of `installinstallmacos.py` inadvertently (or this script will fail). A package will be provided on GitHub for this and subsequent versions. Note that `erase-install.sh` is installed into `/Library/Management/erase-install`. I deliberately have not put `erase-install.sh` into the PATH.
- Added the `--user` and `--stdinpass` arguments when running on a Silicon Mac. Silicon Macs require an admin user and password to run `startosinstall`.
- Now treats `10.x` or `11`+ as major versions for OS comparisons.
- Fix in `installinstallmacos.py` for `os` comparisons failing where no Version is provided from the catalog.

## [0.15.6]

20.11.2020

- Fixed comparison of build numbers when checking the installed build is newer than the build in the downloaded installer.

## [0.15.5]

07.10.2020

- Version comparisons are now done based on `BuildVersion` instead of `ProductVersion` so as not to rely on Major/Minor/Point comparisons (thanks to Greg Neagle's MacSysAdmin 2020 presentation about Big Sur for tips on this).
- code clean up using ShellCheck.

## [0.15.4]

31.07.2020

- Added `--pythonpath` option so that you can select a different python with which to run `installinstallmacos.py`. Default is `$(which python)`.
- `installinstallmacos.py` now has a `--warnings` option about whether to show the Notes/Warnings in the list output or not. This has been hard-coded into `erase-install.sh` to maintain current behaviour.

## [0.15.3]

22.07.2020

- Fixed another small piece of failed logic around the check for whether there is already an installer which was finding other apps with `macOS` in the name. Now, only apps with `Install macOS*.app` will be found.

## [0.15.2]

14.07.2020

- Fixed some failed logic around the check for whether there is already an installer in the `/Applications` folder which was erroneously also looking in other locations.

## [0.15.1]

23.06.2020

- Parameters can now be supplied as `--argument value` as an alternative to `--argument=value` to provide more consistency with the included tools (`installinstallmacos.py` and `softwareupdate`).

## [0.15.0]

09.06.2020

- Adds `--allowremoval` option to the `startosinstall` command by default. This is an undocumented flag which is required under certain circumstances where there are backup files on the system disk.

## [0.14.0]

06.05.2020

- Adds `--replace_invalid` option for the option to overwrite a cached installer if it is not valid for use with `--erase` or `--reinstall`.
- Adds `--update` option for the option to overwrite a cached installer if a newer installer is available.

## [0.13.0]

04.05.2020

- Adds `--preservecontainer` option for workflows that need to retain a container when performing `eraseinstall`.
- Adds additional flags to `caffeinate` to attempt to more robustly prevent device sleeping.
- Fix for missing heading in the full screen display of the `--reinstall` option.
- Added a test script `tests/test-erase-install.sh` for testing out functionality.

## [0.12.1]

14.04.2020

- Use `--forcequitapps` when _using_ the macOS Catalina installer, rather than just when _running_ on a macOS Catalina client (issue #25).

## [0.12.0]

13.02.2020

- Removed downloaded OS validity check for modes where the installer is not required for reinstall or eraseinstall, to prevent unnecessary exit failures.
- Fixed a problem preveting `--move` from working when overwriting a valid installer.
- Other small bugfixes.

## [0.11.1]

03.02.2020

- Restricted the add forcequitapps install_args option to macOS 10.15 or greater, as this is not functional with older versions (#35). Thanks to '@ahousseini' for the contribution.

## [0.11.0]

22.01.2020

- Added the `--sameos` option, so you can have a single command which will always try to reinstall whatever macOS (major) version is currently installed on the host.

## [0.10.1]

11.12.2019

- Removed check that a user is logged in before proceeding with startosinstall - apparently not necessary after all, and caused at least one user's workflow to break (#33).

## [0.10.0]

27.11.2019

- Add a check that there is enough disk space before proceeding
- Added --forcequitapps argument for 10.15 and above
- Check that a user is logged in before proceeding with startosinstall
- Improved find commands when checking that there is a mounted installer
- Improved German descriptions for reinstallation
- Improved checks for successful downloads from the --fetch_full_installer option

Thanks to '@ahousseini' for various contributions to this release

## [0.9.1]

15.11.2019

- Move a comment that states that --fetch-full-installer is available to the correct place (#31)

## [0.9.0]

07.10.2019

- Added support for `softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer` and `seedutil` for clients running macOS 10.15 or greater.

## [0.8.0]

27.09.2019

- Fixed caffeinate (forgot to make it a background process)
- Added 'Confirm' option for erasing. Thanks to '@ryan-alectrona' for the contribution.

## [0.7.1]

26.09.2019

- Added caffeinate to the script to prevent the computer going to sleep during long download phases etc.

## [0.7.0]

12.07.2019

- Added `--beta` option.
- Changed behaviour of `--os`, `--version` and auto (i.e. no flag) options to get the latest rather than earliest valid build.
- Removed `install-macos.sh` script. Use `erase-install.sh` with `--reinstall` option instead.

## [0.6.0]

19.06.2019

- Added `--reinstall` option, which obsoletes the `install-macos.sh` script.

## [0.5.0]

16.04.2019

- Bug fix for empty extra packages folder.  
  Thanks to '@Avartharian' for contributions
- Added `--catalogurl` and `--seedprogram` options

## [0.4.0]

02.04.2019

- Added localisation of Jamf Helper messages.  
  Thanks to '@ahousseini' for contributions
- Added `--os`, `--path`, `--extras`, `--list` options.  
  Thanks to '@mark lamont' for contributions

## [0.3.2]

13.12.2018

- Bug fix for `--build` option, and for exiting gracefully when nothing is downloaded.

## [0.3.1]

21.09.2018

- Added ability to specify a macOS version.
- Fixed the `--overwrite` flag.
- Added ability to specify a build in the parameters, and we now clear out the cached content.

03.09.2018

- Additional and amended options for selecting non-standard builds.

## [0.2.0]

09.07.2018

- Automatically selects a non-beta installer.

## 0.1.0

29.03.2018
